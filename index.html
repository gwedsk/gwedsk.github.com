        Gaurav had known Kamakshi for over 2 years now and he was very happy with how things were. Then one of Gaurav’s close friend got married & he started thinking about marriage too. Within a short time Gaurav realized that she is the one and he finally asked her the big question. The answer from Kamakshi was obviously YES!

                Gaurav knew it was time. Kamakshi and he had been together for over two years, and he wanted to spend his life with her.

            <p>
                Gaurav wanted to ask in style.

            <p>
                Kamakshi had not expected a thing; she assumed Gaurav was procrastinating on this whole marriage thing.

        With many months of friendship Gaurav & Kamakshi began to connect well. Love for food, foosball, music got them close & they began feeling a special bond. Finally, both of them mutually admitted the liking towards each other and things clicked :).

        <p>Gaurav met Kams when he was in <i>that</i> phase of life where he learnt guitar and jammed his songs up his friends throats ;). Kams was one of the few who genuinely listened to (<i>felt for</i>) him. She actually enjoyed it. </p>
		
		<p>Of course, now that he has become very good at it, every one enjoys "Jam with Nemade" sessions.</p>
		
		<p>Probably should also mention their mutual admiration for <i>Andaz Apna Apna</i>.</p>

    <p>
        Kamakshi and Gaurav were working in Deloitte, but in different divisions. Shortly after Gaurav joined Deloitte, the two met through a common friend during lunch hours.(Obligatory mention about the passionate foodie in Kamakshi :D )
    </p>
    <p>
        Both Gaurav and Kams developed this beautiful friendship that was filled with joy and caring and who knew it would evolve into this marvellous journey for their lives.
