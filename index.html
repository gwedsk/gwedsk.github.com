      "We never thought that our sweet little friendship will get us to this day where love will dominate and we will exchange marriage vows. Hopefully you will be there to:
	  Make us nervous while we perform a couple dance at Sangeet, 
	  Dance on "Aaj mere yaar ki shaadi hai" in baaraat,
	  Pair up to strategize "how to hide or steal the Jootis",
	  Pull our leg when we get the couple photo shoot done ;)
	And most important, to be a part of the biggest day of our lives"

        Gaurav had known Kamakshi for over 2 years now and he was very happy with how things were. Then one of Gaurav’s close friend got married & he started thinking about marriage too. Within a short time Gaurav realized that she is the one and he finally asked her the big question. The answer from Kamakshi was obviously YES!

                Kamakshi had not expected a thing; she assumed Gaurav was procrastinating on this whole marriage thing.

        With many months of friendship Gaurav & Kamakshi began to connect well. Love for food, foosball, music got them close & they began feeling a special bond. Finally, both of them mutually admitted the liking towards each other and things clicked :).

        During this time Gaurav was in that phase of life where he learnt guitar and jammed his songs up his friends throats :P. Kams was one of the few who genuinely liked listening to him. She actually enjoyed it & songs brought them closer. Of course, now that he has become very good at it, every one enjoys "Jam with Nemade" sessions.

   Kamakshi and Gaurav were working in Deloitte, but in different divisions. They met at a friends house warming party. During there first encounter Gaurav thought that Kamakshi was so sweet & beautiful while Kamakshi had not even noticed him :P. But in coming days, they developed a beautiful friendship that was filled with joy and care and who knew it would evolve into this marvelous journey for their lives.
