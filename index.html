                Gaurav knew it was time. Kamakshi and he had been together for over two years, and he wanted to spend his life with her.

            <p>
                Gaurav wanted to ask in style.

            <p>
                Kamakshi had not expected a thing; she assumed Gaurav was procrastinating on this whole marriage thing.

    <p>
        Kamakshi and Gaurav were working in Deloitte, but in different divisions. Shortly after Gaurav joined Deloitte, the two met through a common friend during lunch hours.(Obligatory mention about the passionate foodie in Kamakshi :D )
    </p>
    <p>
        Both Gaurav and Kams developed this beautiful friendship that was filled with joy and caring and who knew it would evolve into this marvellous journey for their lives.
